# streamlines-on-the-flow-field


In this application I implemented my own zooming and panning features and my own draw streamlines. Zooming and panning is pretty straight forward the user will have three slider. One for zoom and two for panning X and panning Y. The idea is to give the user the freedom to interact with the image without any problems. The data is being shown in a rectangle 500*500 and it is shifted by 250 and 200. The zoom slider allows the user to zoom out/in. The image is being drawn also by using a color map. The user can also draw streamlines by just clicking the position of the image that he/she needs. The program will also re-size the streamlines if the user tries to zoom in or zoom out. The user can adjust by using the slider the dt and the number of the step. Moreover, the user can actually select to erase the streamlines and/or have them sync. The sync option is basically an option that allows the user if it is on to have all the streamlines already drawn or the streamlines that are going to be drawn have the same dt and number of step. If that option is off then the user can draw different lines with different dt and steps without any problems. 


the results looks like this:
